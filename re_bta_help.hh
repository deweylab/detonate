"REF-EVAL-BUILD-TRUE-ASSEMBLY: A program to estimate the \"true\" assembly of\n"
"         a set of reads, relative to a set of reference sequences\n"
"\n"
"Overview\n"
"\n"
"   This program constructs an estimate of the \"true\" assembly of a set\n"
"   of reads, relative to a set of reference sequences, based on\n"
"   alignment information produced by RSEM.\n"
"\n"
"   As defined by DETONATE [1], the \"true\" assembly of a set of reads,\n"
"   relative to the true transcript sequences that the reads were\n"
"   generated from, is the set of contiguous subsequences of the\n"
"   transcript sequences that are covered by reads, with the reads\n"
"   overlapping by at least --min-overlap bases, when each read is\n"
"   aligned to its true location of origin.\n"
"\n"
"   In practice, we do not know the reads' true locations of origin; in\n"
"   fact, we do not even know (precisely) the true transcript sequences\n"
"   that the reads were generated from. Instead, we start with a set of\n"
"   reference sequences (e.g., an Ensembl reference), and we align each\n"
"   read to these reference sequences using RSEM/Bowtie. The current\n"
"   program chooses a subset of these alignments, according to a policy\n"
"   specified by --alignment-policy and --min-alignment-prob, and then\n"
"   builds our best guess as to the \"true\" assembly based on these\n"
"   alignments.\n"
"\n"
"   [1] Bo Li*, Nathanael Fillmore*, Yongsheng Bai, Mike Collins, James\n"
"   A. Thompson, Ron Stewart, Colin N. Dewey. Evaluation of de novo\n"
"   transcriptome assemblies from RNA-Seq data.\n"
"\n"
"Example usage\n"
"\n"
"   First, use a recent version of RSEM to quantify the expression of the\n"
"   full-length transcripts relative to the reads. For example:\n"
"\n"
" $ rsem-prepare-reference --gtf mm9.ensembl63.filtered.gtf mm9.fa ref\n"
" $ rsem-calculate-expression --num-threads 24 reads.fq ref expr\n"
"\n"
"   Second, use this program to build the \"true\" assembly:\n"
"\n"
" $ ./ref-eval-build-true-assembly --reference ref --expression expr --assembly cc\n"
"\n"
"   This will output a file, cc_0.fa, that contains the \"true\" assembly.\n"
"\n"
"General options\n"
"\n"
"   -? [ --help ]\n"
"\n"
"           Display this information.\n"
"\n"
"Options that specify input and output\n"
"\n"
"   --reference arg\n"
"\n"
"           The prefix of the reference built by rsem-prepare-reference.\n"
"           Required.\n"
"\n"
"   --expression arg\n"
"\n"
"           The prefix of the expression built by\n"
"           rsem-calculate-expression. Required.\n"
"\n"
"   --assembly arg\n"
"\n"
"           A prefix to write the \"true\" assembly or sequence of\n"
"           assemblies to. The suffix \"_x.fa\" will be appended to this\n"
"           prefix, where x is the minimum overlap size. Required.\n"
"\n"
"Options that change the output\n"
"\n"
"   --min-overlap arg\n"
"\n"
"           Either:\n"
"\n"
"              * An integer that specifies how much overlap between two\n"
"                reads is required to merge two reads. For example, if\n"
"                --min-overlap=3, then only reads whose chosen alignments\n"
"                overlap by at least 3 bases will be joined into contigs.\n"
"                If --min-overlap=0, then only reads whose chosen\n"
"                alignments are contiguous (or overlap by a positive\n"
"                amount) will be joined into contigs.\n"
"\n"
"           Or:\n"
"\n"
"              * A pair of integers, separated by commas, specifying a\n"
"                range of overlap sizes, as described above. For example,\n"
"                if --min-overlap=2,4 is given, then three assemblies\n"
"                will be produced, corresponding to --min-overlap=2,\n"
"                --min-overlap=3, and --min-overlap=4. You might use this\n"
"                option to compute ideal assemblies at all overlap sizes,\n"
"                e.g., --min-overlap=0,76 for 76-length reads.\n"
"\n"
"           Default: 0.\n"
"\n"
"   --min-alignment-prob arg\n"
"\n"
"           A number between 0 and 1 (inclusive). Any alignment (of a\n"
"           read to a reference transcript) with posterior probability,\n"
"           as calculated by RSEM, strictly less than this value will be\n"
"           discarded. Noise reads, with posterior probability exactly 0,\n"
"           are always discarded. Default: 0.\n"
"\n"
"   --alignment-policy arg\n"
"\n"
"           The policy used to choose which alignment(s) of each read to\n"
"           use in constructing the \"true\" assembly. Options:\n"
"\n"
"              * sample: For each read, sample a single alignment (to\n"
"                some reference transcript) according to the posterior\n"
"                probability that the read follows each alignment, as\n"
"                calculated by RSEM.\n"
"              * best: For each read, choose the alignment that maximizes\n"
"                the posterior probability mentioned above. Ties are\n"
"                broken arbitrarily but deterministically (the first\n"
"                alignment in the BAM file is used).\n"
"              * all: For each read, use all its alignments. Some reads\n"
"                might end up with more than one alignment. In that case,\n"
"                contigs will be made assuming that the read aligns to\n"
"                each place. (In other words, the read is effectively\n"
"                duplicated, with one copy per alignment.)\n"
"\n"
"           This policy is applied after the thresholding implied by\n"
"           --min-alignment-prob. For example, if\n"
"           \"--min-alignment-prob=0.10 --alignment-policy=sample\" is\n"
"           given, then (first) all alignments with posterior probability\n"
"           less than 0.10 will be discarded, and (second), for each\n"
"           read, an alignment will be sampled from among the remaining\n"
"           alignments, with the posterior distribution renormalized as\n"
"           appropriate. As another example, if\n"
"           \"--min-alignment-prob=0.90 --alignment-policy=all\" is given,\n"
"           then all alignments with posterior probability at least 0.90\n"
"           will be used.\n"
"\n"
"           Default: sample.\n"
