To build REF-EVAL, simply run "make" from the current directory. This will
build two executables (plus a few dependent libraries), ./ref-eval and
./ref-eval-build-true-assembly, which you can run from the current directory or
move elsewhere. (The executables are statically linked with their local
dependencies, so you don't need to worry about the library path.) For
information about how to run REF-EVAL once it is built, see ./ref-eval --help
and ./ref-eval-build-true-assembly --help.

If the "make" command fails, you might need to tweak the build process a bit.
To do so, edit ./Makefile and make changes as appropriate to the section marked
"Configuration". Then run "make" again.

REF-EVAL comes with a number of unit tests. To build and run these tests, run
"make test" from the current directory. A C++11-compatible compiler is required
to build some of the tests. To be clear, the tests are mainly useful for
developers, not normal users of the software. It isn't necessary for users to
build or run the tests.
